# Contract

This agreement outlines the working arrangements for our project team. We agree to work together to achieve our goals and commit to the following terms:

1. Work Distribution: The team will make sure that the work is divided equally and that everyone is contributing fairly. This means that no one member of the team will be expected to do more work than others, and we will consider everyone's wordload while assigning tasks.

2. Work Hours: The team expects to work a total of 8-12 hours per week on the project. This means that each member of the team should be able to commit to this amount of time each week to ensure that the project progresses.

3. Group Meetings: The team will have at least two group meetings - one for assigning work and one for updates on progress. These meetings will preferably be held in person, to ensure that everyone is on the same page and to encourage effective communication. Otherwise, the meetings can also be held online via zoom. We will turn on our cameras to make sure we are communicating and cooperating efficiently.

4. Meeting Agendas and Minutes: The team will use When2meet and slack each week to schedule meetings. We will have a shared google doc file update resources on this file during the meeting. This will ensure that everyone has access to the same information and can refer back to previous meetings if needed.

5. Style of Working: The team will divide the work into individual milestones and set deadlines to meet each milestone. This means that each member of the team will be responsible for completing specific tasks by a certain deadline, to ensure that the project is progressing as planned.

6. Progress Updates: Each member of the team will provide a weekly summary of their progress on each milestone. These updates will be similar to lab reports and will help to keep everyone up-to-date on the progress of the project.

7. Availability: The team will be available during class time which would be Monday to Thursday from 8:30 AM to 6 PM. We will also spend time on Friday and weekends to work on the project, but considering everyone might have something else to do, we must respond within 12 hours of request. We will probably not hold meetings in the evenings, to ensure that everyone has time for their personal life.

8. Project Manager: The team will work together, and there will be no specific project manager. This means that everyone will be responsible for keeping the project on track and making sure that deadlines are met.

9. Code of Conduct: The team is expected to be polite and respectful towards each other, and to communicate effectively. Rude behaviour, lack of communication, and lack of contribution are unacceptable.

10. Code Review: The team will preferably volunteer for code review but will divide the work depending on the workload. This means that everyone will have the opportunity to review code and provide feedback, to ensure that the quality of the code is high.

11. Aim: The team would like to aim to have the project to be completed. We agree to abide by these terms and work together as a team to achieve our goals.

Signed,

Grace, Liangchen, Sherry, Jessie, Dave
